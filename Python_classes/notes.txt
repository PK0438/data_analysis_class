# Exception Handling
- Syntactical errors
    Grammatical errors
- Usage errors: End user causes these errors

Whenever there is an exception the application fails. 

#try construct syntax

try: 
    statment(s) # code you want to run/execute
except:
    statement(s)


----------- Exception Hierarchy --------------

Exception                           # Parent of all exceptions (default, no need to mention in the except block)
    OSError                         # OS related errors
        FileExistsError
        FileNotFoundError
    ValueError

Note: While handling errors, handle from specific to general


# multiple exception classes
# Syntax
try: 
    statment(s) # code you want to run/execute
except [ExceptionType] [as e]:
    statement(s)
[except [ExceptionType] [as e]:
    statement(s)]...

- The code inside the final clause always executes

- Use exit() function from sys module when you want to end the execution

Rising an error using 'raise' statement:
raise ErrorName('message')


---------Working with files-----------

File is an object.
Two types of files:
    - Text
        Sequence of characters and lines
        At the end of each line there is a new line (\n) character
        .txt, .html, .csv, .json, .xml etc,.

    - Binary
        Sequence of bytes
        .exe, .msi, .compressed, .image, .audio, .video etc,.

--------Working with TEXT files-------
File operations:
1. open
2. read from the file or write to the file
3. close

# 1. open a file - takes two arguments
open(filename, mode)

- filename (may include path of the file)
- mode: read, write, append, binary, etc        # should specify the mode of operation
    - When you open a file with a specific mode, open function creates a fileObject which is assign to a variable to work with the file. 

=> mode
    1. r (read)     # default - no need to mention explicitly 
        - this mode returns an exception when a file does not exists. 
    2. w (write)
        - This mode creates a file if it doesn't exists. 
        - CAUTION: This mode truncates a file (erases data from the existing file.)
    3. a (append)
        - This mode creates a file if it doesn't exists. 
        - If the file already exists then it will append the data to the file. 
    4. b (binary)
        - 'rb' for reading binary files
        - 'wb' for writing to binary files


### The 'with' statement in Python
Using with statement in Python we can close a file automatically without explicitly using the close() method.

### Referencing a file:
1. Absolute reference
    D:\\Office\\Projects\\2025\\Zeneta\\Docs\\file.txt
2. Relative reference
    file.txt      --------->     file in the same folder
    ./file.txt    --------->     file in the same folder
    ../file.txt   --------->     file in the parent folder


### Reading data from a file using three methods
1. read()
    - Reads the entire file as one single string. 
2. readline()
    - Reads one line at a time
        where each line of a list
