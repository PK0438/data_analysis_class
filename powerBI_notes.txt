DAX - Data Analysis eXpression
    DAX Expressions------ Calculated Columns
                    |
                    |---- Measures

Syntax for DAX:
        Name = Formula

Name => An Object
        Table, Column, Measure

Referring objects in the DAX Expression:
        Table: 
                TableName (Should have no spaces)
        Column: 
                [ColumnName]
                TableName[ColumnName]
        Measure: 
                [Measure]

CALENDAR Table
        Time-Intelligence Calculations

CALENDAR function:
-------------------
CALENDAR( start_date, end_date )
    -> returns start_date to end_date, including start and end dates. 

start_date: Jan 1, XXXX (business_start_year, ex: 2017)
end_date: Dec 32, XXXX (current_year_end ex: 2025)

DATE function:
----------------
DATE(year, month, day)
    -> returns date for the specified values

CALENDAR( DATE(), DATE() )

CALENDAR( DATE(2017, 1, 1), DATE(2019, 12, 31) )

Name = Formula

DateTable = Formula
Calendar = Formula

Calendar = CALENDAR( 
                DATE(2017, 1, 1), 
                DATE(2019, 12, 31) 
                )


DATE: Nov 19, 2025
        Year: 2025
        Month: November
        Day: 19
        MonthNum: 11
        Weekday: Wednesday
        WeekdayNum: 4
        WeekNum: 49 (from 1 to 53)
        etc.,

CALCULATED COLUMNS
-------------------
-> Creating Month column with Month names
-> Have to format the  date (01-01-2017) to get the Month number using FORMAT function

Syntax: 
        FORMAT(value, format_code)                         

FORMAT function will take two parameters
        -> value: number, date, time, datetime
        -> format_code:
                YY:     two-diit year number (25)
                YYYY:   four-digit year number (2025)
                M:      Month number (1-12)
                MM:     Month number with leading zero (01 - 12)
                MMM:    Short month name (Jan - Dec)
                MMMM:   Full month name (January - December)
                D:      Day number (1- 13)   
                DD:     Day number with leading zero (01 - 31)
                DDD:    Short week day name (Sun - Sat)
                DDDD:   Full Week day name (Sunday - Saturday)

-> calculated column for month column formula should be

                Month = FORMAT( [DATE], "MMMM" )


'Year' column with year numbers
--------------------------------

Syntax: 
        YEAR(date)
                -> Returns year number from the date value

-> Calculated column from Year column formula should be
        
        Year = YEAR([Date])

-> Convert the Year column data type format as text because, we don't need to performa any arithemetic operations on it. 


'MonthNum' column with month numbers
-------------------------------------

Syntax: 
        MONTH( Date )
                -> Returns month number (1-12) from thre date values

-> Calculated column from MonthNum column formula should be

        MonthNum = Month( [Date] )

-> Should not change the data type of the MonthNum column to text. Because if you change, it will sort the month numbers based on the first character, which is wrong. 

Text sorting                            Number sorting
1                                       1
10                                      2
11                                      3
12                                      4
2                                       5
3                                       6
4                                       7
5                                       8
6                                       9
7                                       10
8                                       11
9                                       12

-> So in column tools -> Summarization -> Don't summarize
        -> which means no operations should be perform on this column


'WeekNum' Column with week numbers
-------------------------------------
-> There is a seperate function to calclate the week number. it's not there in the format_code

Syntax:
        WEEKNUM( [Date] )
                -> Returns week number (1-53) from the date value. 

-> Calculated column from WeekNum column formula should be

        WeekNum = WEEKNUM( [Date] )


'Weekday' column with weekday names
------------------------------------

        Weekday = FORMAT( [Date], "DDDD" )


'WeekdayNum' column with weekday number
----------------------------------------
-> If we give Date as a param to the WEEKDAY function it will give 1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday and so on, 7 for Saturday. 
-> It is dependent on Weekday column

        WeekdayNum = WEEKDAY( [Date] )

-> TO start the weekdayNum to start with Monday, which means 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday and so on, 7 for Sunday

        WeekdayNum = WEEKDAY( [Date], 2)
                        -> Have to pass an another argument which weekday number to start with. 
                        -> 1 - Sunday, 2 - Monday, 3 - Tuesday, 4 - Wednesday, 5 - Thursday, 6 - Friday, 7 - Saturday


'IsWorkDay' column as 1 for workday, 0 for Weekend
----------------------------------------------------
-> Mon - Fri (weekdays) - 1
-> Sat & Sun (weekends) - 0
-> It is dependent on weekday column

-> We have to use IF condition in this case

Syntax:        
        IF ( condition, if_true, if_false )
                -> IF condition will take 3 arguments, condition, if_true and if_false
                -> if the condition is true it will go with the second argument
                -> if the condition is false it will go with the third argument

-> Calculated column from IsWorkDay column formula should be

       isWorkday =  IF( [WeekdayNum] <= 5, 1, 0 )




Power BI report
---------------

-> If the date type is number and summarization is sum by default report will take Clusterd Column Chart
-> If the date type is text and summarization is don't summarize by default report will take Clusterd Column Chart

Chart 1
-------
-> Clustered column chart
        -> Y axis: IsWorkday 
        -> X Axis: Month

-> Months will not be in the order, to make Months column in order, 
        -> Go to the 3 dots (options) at the top or bottom of the chart, choose sort axis -> month
        -> Go to the same options sort axis -> sort ascending
        -> click Month column in Data pane, go to Column tools, sort by column -> MonthNum
